ObjectBox Swift
===============
[![Version](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/v/ObjectBox.svg?style=flat)](https://cocoapods.org/pods/ObjectBox)
[![Platform](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/p/ObjectBox.svg?style=flat)](https://cocoapods.org/pods/ObjectBox)

ObjectBox is a superfast, light-weight object persistence framework.
This Swift API seamlessly persists objects on-device for iOS and macOS.

```swift
let santa = Person(firstName: "Santa", lastName: "Claus")
try personBox.put(santa)

let query: Query<Person> = personBox.query {
    return (Person.firstName.contains("Santa") || Person.age > 100)
           && Person.lastName.isEqual(to: "Claus") 
}.build()
let oldClauses = query.find()
```

Want details? **[Read the guides](https://swift.objectbox.io/)** or
**[check out the API docs](https://objectbox.io/docfiles/swift/current/)**.

Installation
------------
[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is recommended to set up ObjectBox in your project.
See the [installation docs](https://swift.objectbox.io/install) for alternative setups,
or the [New to CocoaPods?](#new-to-cocoapods) section below for a quick intro.
To install the [ObjectBox pod](https://cocoapods.org/pods/ObjectBox), add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'ObjectBox'
```

Then run this to install the ObjectBox framework:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project/folder/ # whatever folder your Podfile is in.
pod install
Pods/ObjectBox/setup.rb myproject.xcodeproj # whatever your Xcode project is named
```

Now you are all set to define your first ObjectBox entities;
e.g. check the [getting started guide] or the [example](#example) described below. 

### <a name="new-to-cocoapods"></a>New to CocoaPods?

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) it is a dependency manager and sets up libraries like ObjectBox in your xcode project.
To install it, run this in a terminal: 

```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

In CocoaPods, you keep track of used libraries in a file called "Podfile".
If you don't have this file yet, navigate to your xcode project folder and use CocoaPod to create one:

```bash
pod init
```

### CocoaPods troubleshooting

If `pod install` fails, try updating CocoaPods first:

    gem update xcodeproj && gem update cocoapods && pod repo update

<a name="example"></a>Example
-----------------------------
In the [Example](Example/) directory, you find a notes example app demonstrating ObjectBox's Swift API.
The example comes with two apps: one for iOS and one for macOS.

To setup the example, use CocoaPods to acquire the framework:

    cd Example/
    pod install # if that fails, update CocoaPods (see Installation)
    Pods/ObjectBox/setup.rb

This will generate a `NotesExample.xcworkspace` that you can launch to try out ObjectBox.

How can ObjectBox Help You?
---------------------------
We want ObjectBox to be not only the fastest, but also the most Swift-friendly persistence solution.

To do that, we want your feedback: what do you love? What's amiss?
Where do you struggle in everyday app development?

We're looking forward to receiving your comments and requests:

- Take this [short questionaire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd0neiviD0Yal0Tn7921w-XWI2d0ONpLm7TfVKp7OvwW2Tu2A/viewform?usp=sf_link) (takes only 1 or 2 minutes)
- Add [GitHub issues](https://github.com/ObjectBox/objectbox-swift/issues) and 
- Upvote issues you find important by hitting the üëç/+1 reaction button!

Thank you!

Keep in touch
-------------
We're obviously not finished here.
[Sign up here](https://objectbox.io/ios-alpha/) for future updates on ObjectBox Swift.

For general news on ObjectBox, [check our blog](https://objectbox.io/blog).

Background: code generation
---------------------------
ObjectBox Swift generates code at build time for optimal performance at runtime by avoiding reflection etc.
This is automatically done for you and should be transparent.
Internally, we use [a fork of Sourcery](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-swift-generator) for this.

Source code
-----------
Source code for ObjectBox's Swift binding can be found [in the Source folder](Source/README.md).

Other languages/bindings
------------------------
ObjectBox is a multi platform database supporting [multiple languages](https://objectbox.io/dev-get-started/): 

* [ObjectBox C API](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-c): native speed with zero copy access to FlatBuffer objects;
  also enables porting ObjectBox to other languages.
* [ObjectBox Java](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-java): runs on Android, desktop and even servers.
