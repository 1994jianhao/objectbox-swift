ObjectBox is a superfast, light-weight object persistence framework for iOS and macOS.

This is the ObjectBox Swift API reference.
Also check the **[guides](https://swift.objectbox.io/)** for general documentation.

Current version: 0.9.0 (beta)

## Most Important Types

- `Store`: the long-lived connection to your data on disk.
- `Entity`: protocol to mark your type as persistable by ObjectBox.
- `Id`: identifies object instances in the database.
- `Box`: main interface to persist objects and create `Query`s.
- `Query`: conditional fetching of object of a certain type.
