///
/// ## Persisted Properties
///
/// All stored properties of a type that conforms to `Entity` will be persisted, if possible.
/// For numbers, ObjectBox recognizes `Bool`, `Int8`, `Int16`, `Int32`, `Int64`, `Int`, `Float`, and `Double`.
/// It also recognizes `String` and `Date`.
///
/// ## Relations
///
/// To create relations between entities, use `ToOne` and `ToMany` to wrap the target type,
/// like `customer: ToOne<Customer>`.

/// - Note: Used in Alpha 1 only to implement backlinks. When you operate on the level of
///   "a type that conforms to Entity", that's not specific enough; you need to erase the type. This
///   provides specification to get to the concrete Id<T>. Will be replaced in future versions.
